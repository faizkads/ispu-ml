A team project to finish the Associate Data Scientist training from Ditjen DIkti Microcredential.

ISPU-ML is a simple predictor for the average air pollution index in Jakarta.
ISPU, acronym for Index Standar Pencemaran Udara (Air Pollution Standard Index), is an index showing the amount of pollutant that affects air quality.

ISPU-ML aims to be able to predict the accurate measurement of the air quality day-by-day, using machine learning. For presentation purposes, the model was deployed to Flask as a simple web application.
